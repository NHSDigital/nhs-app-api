# NHS App

![Build](https://github.com/NHSDigital/nhs-app-api/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)

This is a RESTful HL7® FHIR® API specification for the NHS App API.

* `specification/` This [Open API Specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) describes the endpoints, methods and messages exchanged by the API. Use it to generate interactive documentation; the contract between the API and its consumers.
* `scripts/` Utilities helpful to developers of this specification.
* `proxies/` Live Apigee API Proxy definitions.

Consumers of the API will find developer documentation on the [NHS Digital Developer Hub](https://developer.digital.nhs.uk/).

## Development

### Requirements
* make
* nodejs + npm/yarn
* [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)
* Java 8+

### Install
```
$ make install
```

#### Updating hooks
You can install some pre-commit hooks to ensure you can't commit invalid spec changes by accident. These are also run
in CI, but it's useful to run them locally too.

```
$ make install-hooks
```

### Environment Variables
Various scripts and commands rely on environment variables being set. These are documented with the commands.

:bulb: Consider using [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to manage your environment variables during development and maintaining your own `.envrc` file - the values of these variables will be specific to you and/or sensitive.

### Make commands
There are `make` commands that alias some of this functionality:
 * `lint` -- Lints the spec and code
 * `publish` -- Outputs the specification as a **single file** into the `build/` directory
 * `serve` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format

### Testing
The `tests/` folder contains some .NET integration tests to verify that the API endpoints can be successfully exercised when presented with valid authentication headers.

### VS Code Plugins

 * [openapi-lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mermade.openapi-lint) resolves links and validates entire spec with the 'OpenAPI Resolve and Validate' command
 * [OpenAPI (Swagger) Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=42Crunch.vscode-openapi) provides sidebar navigation


### Emacs Plugins

 * [**openapi-yaml-mode**](https://github.com/esc-emacs/openapi-yaml-mode) provides syntax highlighting, completion, and path help

### Speccy

> [Speccy](http://speccy.io/) *A handy toolkit for OpenAPI, with a linter to enforce quality rules, documentation rendering, and resolution.*

Speccy does the lifting for the following npm scripts:

 * `test` -- Lints the definition
 * `publish` -- Outputs the specification as a **single file** into the `build/` directory
 * `serve` -- Serves a preview of the specification in human-readable format

(Workflow detailed in a [post](https://developerjack.com/blog/2018/maintaining-large-design-first-api-specs/) on the *developerjack* blog.)

:bulb: The `publish` command is useful when uploading to Apigee which requires the spec as a single file.

### Caveats

#### Swagger UI
Swagger UI unfortunately doesn't correctly render `$ref`s in examples, so use `speccy serve` instead.

#### Apigee Portal
The Apigee portal will not automatically pull examples from schemas, you must specify them manually.

## Deployment

### Specification
Update the API Specification and derived documentation in the Portal.

`make deploy-spec` with environment variables:

* `APIGEE_USERNAME`
* `APIGEE_PASSWORD`
* `APIGEE_SPEC_ID`
* `APIGEE_PORTAL_API_ID`

### API Proxy & Sandbox Service
Redeploy the API Proxy and hosted Sandbox service.

`make deploy-proxy` with environment variables:

* `APIGEE_USERNAME`
* `APIGEE_PASSWORD`
* `APIGEE_ORGANIZATION`
* `APIGEE_ENVIRONMENTS` - Comma-separated list of environments to deploy to (e.g. `test,prod`)
* `APIGEE_APIPROXY` - Name of the API Proxy for deployment
* `APIGEE_BASE_PATH` - The proxy's base path (must be unique)

:bulb: Specify your own API Proxy (with base path) for use during development.

#### Platform setup

Successful deployment of the API Proxy requires:

 1. A *Target Server* named `nhs-app-target`
 2. A *Key-Value Map* named `nhsa-variables`, containing any values you might need at proxy runtime
 2. A *Key-Value Map* named `nhsa-variables-encrypted`, containing any secrets you might need at proxy runtime

:bulb: For Sandbox-running environments (`test`) these need to be present for successful deployment but can be set to empty/dummy values.
