  title: NHS App API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to engage with users of the [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/) - a simple and secure way for patients registered with a GP surgery in England to access a range of services on their smartphone or tablet.

    You can:
    * send in-app messages to specific users of the NHS App
    * send native Apple or Android push notifications to mobile devices registered by specific users of the NHS App

    Currently, this API can only be accessed by organisations that deliver functionality to patients through the NHS App.

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in [alpha](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - we are in the early stages of prototyping and may make extensive breaking changes based on developer feedback
    - we can't guarantee availability or performance
    
    If you have any queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet.
    
    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).
    
    ## Authorisation
    This API is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
    meaning that the calling application is authenticated, but the end user is not authenticated and may not be present.

    The API currently uses an [API key pattern](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-api-key-authentication) to authorise the calling system.

    We are considering transitioning to using the [OAuth 2.0 signed JWT authentication pattern](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication) to authorise the calling system.

    ## Environments and testing

    | Environment       | Base URL                                                       |
    | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Integration test  | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/nhsapp/`                       |
    | Production        | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/nhsapp/`                           |

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing
    * is stateful, so persists updates
    * includes authorisation
        
    Our integration test environment is currently pointing to the Onboarding Sandpit NHS App environment, which in turn is using the Sandpit environment of NHS Login.

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so itâ€™s worth planning well ahead.

    To onboard for this API, please get in touch with the onboarding team at [app.onboarding@nhs.net](mailto:app.onboarding@nhs.net) .

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to request that a communication be sent to one or more patients.
        
        Currently this endpoint can be used to send In-App Messages that appear within the NHS App. We intend to additionally offer functionality to send native Apple and Android Push Notifications in the near future.
        
        Recipients can currently be specified by NHS Number. A single communication request can be sent to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS Numbers.
