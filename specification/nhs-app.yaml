  title: NHS App API
  description: |
    ## Overview
    Use this API to engage with users of the [NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/nhs-services/the-nhs-app/) - a simple and secure way for patients registered with a GP surgery in England to access a range of services on their smartphone or tablet.

    You can:
    * send in-app messages to specific users of the NHS App
    * send native Apple or Android push notifications to mobile devices registered by specific users of the NHS App

    ## Who can use this API?
    This API can only be accessed by organisations that deliver functionality to citizens through the NHS App.

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in [private beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#api-status), meaning:
    - we might make breaking changes, but only if we can't avoid it, and we'll give advance notice
    - we can't guarantee availability or performance

    To see our roadmap, or to suggest, comment or vote on features for this API, see our [interactive product backlog](https://nhs-digital-api-management.featureupvote.com/?order=popular&filter=allexceptdone&tag=nhs-app-api).

    If you have any queries, please [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#basic-rest).

    It also conforms to the FHIR global standard for health care data exchange. Specifically, it is aligned with FHIR UK Core, which is built on FHIR Release 4.

    You don't need to know much about FHIR to use this API - FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:

    - resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/CommunicationRequest` not `/communicationRequests`
    
    - array names are singular, for example `recipient` not `recipients` for communication recipients

    - data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet, and, indirectly, on the [Health and Social Care Network (HSCN)](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/health-and-social-care-network).

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Authorisation
    This API is [application-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#application-restricted-apis),
    meaning we authenticate the calling application but not the end user. In particular, the three FHIR `CommunicationRequest` endpoints use signed JWT authentication - you authenticate your application by sending a signed JSON web token (JWT) to our OAuth 2.0 authorisation server. For more details see [Application-restricted RESTful APIs - signed JWT authentication](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication).

    The non-FHIR `communication` endpoint used an API key pattern to authorise the calling system. This endpoint has been deprecated and will soon be removed from the API. It should no longer be used.

    ## Environments and testing
    | API Environment      | NHS Login Environment | Base URL                                    |
    | -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
    | Development          | Sandpit               | `https://dev.api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-app/`   |
    | Integration Testing  | AOS                   | `https://int.api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-app/`   |
    | Production           | Production            | `https://api.service.nhs.uk/nhs-app/`       |

    ### Development
    Our development environment:
    * includes authorisation
    * is for initial development and [integration testing](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing)
    * points to the Onboarding Sandpit NHS App environment, which in turn is using the NHS Login Sandpit environment

    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * includes authorisation
    * is for formal release testing and assurance when onboarding with NHS Login
    * points to the Onboarding AOS NHS App environment, which in turn is using the NHS Login AOS environment

    For more details see [integration testing with our RESTful APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing-with-our-restful-apis).

    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so itâ€™s worth planning well ahead.

    To onboard for this API, please get in touch with the NHS App onboarding team at [app.onboarding@nhs.net](mailto:app.onboarding@nhs.net) .

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send an in-app message to one or more NHS App users.

        Recipients are specified by NHS Number. A single request to this endpoint can send an identical message to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS Numbers.

        We support a subset of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for describing the body text of in-app messages. The length of each in-app message is limited to 5000 characters, including any markdown characters and embedded hyperlinks.

        The body of requests made to this endpoint are instances of [HL7 FHIR R4 CommunicationRequest](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/communicationrequest.html) resources. This schema documentation describes which fields on that resource we require and support. The API is tolerant of (but will silently ignore) any additionally supplied optional fields. For example, we do not currently honour the [doNotPerform](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/communicationrequest-definitions.html#CommunicationRequest.doNotPerform) or [priority](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/communicationrequest-definitions.html#CommunicationRequest.priority) fields.

        Use this endpoint to send a native Apple or Android push notifications to mobile devices registered by specific users of the NHS App.

        Recipients are specified by NHS Number. A single request to this endpoint can send an identical push notification to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS Numbers.

        The body text of notifications can be up to 200 characters in length.

        They must not contain
          * personally identifiable information (for example:the name of a user's doctor)
          * sensitive information (for example:details about a health condition)
          * links to external websites

        You can also optionally specify a URL for a page within the NHS App to be opened when the recipient taps on the push notification. If a URL is not specified, the NHS App will open on the home page.

        ## Overview
        Use this endpoint to send an in-app message followed immediately by an associated native Apple or Android push notification to one or more NHS App users.

        Recipients are specified by NHS Number. A single request to this endpoint can send an identical message and push notification to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS Numbers.

        If a recipient is an active NHS App user but has not registered a device to receive native push notifications, they will still receive the in-app message.

        This endpoint allows you to specify the content that will appear in the in-app message. It does not allow you to specify the content that will appear in the associated push notification. The content of the push notification will always default to standardised text that currently reads "You have a new message. This may contain important information". When a recipient taps the native notification, the NHS App will open on the in-app messaging inbox page.

        We support a subset of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for describing the body text of in-app messages. The length of each in-app message is limited to 5000 characters, including any markdown characters and embedded hyperlinks.

        The body of requests made to this endpoint are instances of [HL7 FHIR R4 CommunicationRequest](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/communicationrequest.html) resources. This schema documentation describes which fields on that resource we require and support. The API is tolerant of (but will silently ignore) any additionally supplied optional fields.

        ## Overview

        **This non-FHIR endpoint has been deprecated and will soon be removed from the API. It should no longer be used. Instead, please use one of the three FHIR R4 CommunicationRequest endpoints, depending on whether your use case requires sending a communication via in-app message only, push notification only, or both in-app message with an associated push notification.**

        You can send:
          * in-app messages to specific users of the NHS App
          * native Apple or Android push notifications to mobile devices registered by specific users of the NHS App

        Recipients are specified by NHS Number. A single communication request can be sent to between 1 and 100 distinct NHS Numbers.
