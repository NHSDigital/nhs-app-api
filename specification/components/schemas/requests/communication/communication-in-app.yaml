    description: FHIR Resource Type – this must be `CommunicationRequest`.
  identifier:
    type: array
    description: |
      An optional array of identifiers used to identify this request for later analysis.
      
      We have defined the following two systems for identifiers that will be stored with the request:

      * Campaign ID – denoted by system https://fhir.nhs.uk/NHSApp/campaign-id .  This is an optional campaign identifier, used for later identification of a group of multiple communication requests. For example, this could be used to identify all messages that pertain to invitations for a particular vaccination programme.
      * Request Reference – denoted by system https://fhir.nhs.uk/NHSApp/request-id . This is an optional request identifier, used for later identification of a specific request.

      Note that these identifier system names are case-sensitive. The values provided for each of these two identifiers are limited to 50 characters, and must not match the regular expression `<(.|\n)*?>`.
      No more than one campaign ID and one request reference can be supplied with each request.

      The API will not reject requests that contain other identifier systems, but these values will be ignored and not recorded against the request.

      When a `CommunicationRequest` resource is returned in the response body to a successful request, this array will also include a globally unique identifier assigned by the API, with the system `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-app-communication-id`. This is the same logical ID contained within the `Location` header of the successful response.
