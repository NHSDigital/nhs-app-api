      An array of identifiers used to identify the original communication request that is referenced by this receipt.

      This array will always include a globally unique identifier for the communication request assigned by the API, with the system `https://fhir.nhs.uk/Id/nhs-app-communication-id`. Note that several receipts may be included for each communication ID â€“ for example a single in-app message might generate a Delivered receipt and a Read receipt.

      It will include optional identifiers that were provided in the original communication request if the API recognised the identifier system name.
